docker compose exec backend wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:10000/health
```

**2. Verify Domain Configuration**
```bash
# Check Caddyfile configuration
cat Caddyfile

# Verify DNS resolution
nslookup your-domain.com
dig your-domain.com

# Test domain accessibility
curl -I http://your-domain.com
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443 -servername your-domain.com
```

**3. Check MediaMTX Status**
```bash
# Check MediaMTX API
curl http://localhost:9997/v3/paths/list
curl http://localhost:9997/v3/paths/list | jq .

# Check MediaMTX configuration
docker compose exec mediamtx cat /mediamtx.yml

# Check MediaMTX logs

# Check firewall rules
sudo ufw status
sudo iptables -L

# Test external connectivity
curl -I http://your-server-ip:80
curl -I http://your-server-ip:443
```

**7. SSL Certificate Issues**
```bash
# Check Let's Encrypt rate limits
# Visit: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/

# Check Caddy data directory
ls -la caddy_data/
ls -la caddy_config/

# Verify certificate files
find caddy_data -name "*.crt" -exec openssl x509 -in {} -text -noout \;
```

#### Dashboard Video Not Loading

If the dashboard video is not loading, follow these troubleshooting steps:

**1. Verify Stream Creation**
- Ensure you've successfully created a cloud stream
- Check that the stream shows as "Active" in the dashboard
- Verify the camera ID and HLS URL are correct

**2. Check Bridge Status**
```bash
# Verify bridge is running
ps aux | grep bridge.py

# Check bridge logs for errors
# Look for connection status and error messages

# Test bridge connectivity
curl -I "https://yourdomain.com/hls/cam-XXXX/stream.m3u8"
```

**3. Check Browser Network Tab**
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Refresh the page
- Look for failed requests to HLS endpoints
- Check for CORS errors or 404 responses

**4. Verify HLS Stream**
```bash
# Test HLS playlist
curl "https://yourdomain.com/hls/cam-XXXX/stream.m3u8"

# Test HLS segments
curl "https://yourdomain.com/hls/cam-XXXX/segment0.ts"

# Check MediaMTX paths
curl http://localhost:9997/v3/paths/list | jq .
```

**5. Common Solutions**
- Refresh the page and wait for stream to load
- Disconnect and reconnect the camera
- Check if camera is still streaming to the bridge
- Verify domain and SSL certificate are working
- Clear browser cache and cookies

#### "NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact" Warning

This is a browser security feature that prevents videos from automatically playing with sound. You may see this warning in the console, but it doesn't affect functionality. The video will still play when:

1. The user interacts with the page
2. The video is muted (which our application handles)

#### Browser Compatibility Issues

For best results:
- Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
- Safari may have limitations with HLS streams
- Ensure your browser is up to date
